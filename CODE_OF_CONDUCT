We are committed to fostering an open, safe, and welcoming environment.

## Our Standards

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project  
- Showing empathy and kindness to others  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments  
- Public or private harassment, including stalking or intimidation  
- Publishing others' private information (such as physical or email address) without explicit permission  
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting **Parsa Shaabani** (project maintainer) at **[your email/contact here]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of reporters.

## Enforcement Guidelines

1. **Correction** – A private, written warning with clarity around the nature of the violation.  
2. **Warning** – A warning with consequences for continued behavior.  
3. **Temporary Ban** – Temporary removal from participation in the project community.  
4. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent removal from participation in the project community.
